## About The 100
This project's actual concept is to design and develop a First-Person Perspective (FPP) shooting game including AI agents as an enemy. First Person Shooting (FPS) provides realistic effects and also consent players to aim their shots rather than complex gaming. Developing AI Bots by in-depth reinforcement learning, agents learn skills such as searching for enemies in unfamiliar areas and multi-batch of dangerous targets. FPS with AI agents eliminates the boring effects from the game also a better approach to train the agents competent as we want to increase more thrill as the level increases. AI bots will automatically sense the player’s presence and will attack at player according to his position.
